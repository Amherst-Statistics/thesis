# Abstract {.unnumbered} 

The abstract should be a short, one-paragraph summary of your thesis work. If it extends onto a second page, it is too long.



# Acknowledgements {.unnumbered} 

Use this space to acknowledge and thank those who have helped you in the thesis process (professors, staff, friends, family, etc.). If you had special funding to conduct your thesis work, that should be acknowledged here as well.
